title: Inviting candidates
description: Invite candidates to a take-home by email, and track their state.
---

Candidates join a take-home through an email invite. Each invite is tied to a
single email address and, once accepted, gives that candidate a private copy of
the assessment.

## Sending an invite

From the source assessment, send an invite to the candidate's email address.
Typelets generates a unique invite link for that address. You can invite as many
candidates as you like; each gets their own private workspace and the invites do
not interfere with one another.

## What the candidate does

1. They open the invite link and sign in (or create an account with the invited
   address).
2. They accept the invite. Accepting **clones** the source assessment into a new
   private workspace: the starter files, prompt, rubric, and settings are copied
   in as they stood at accept time.
3. They land in their own workspace, ready to start when they are. Starting is a
   separate, deliberate step, covered in [The candidate
   experience](/assessments/candidate-experience/).

An invite link is single-purpose: it is for the address it was sent to, and it
expires. An expired or already-used link shows the candidate a clear message
rather than silently failing.

## Tracking candidate state

On the source assessment, your sidebar lists every **accepted** candidate and
their current state. An invite that has not been accepted yet is not in this
list.

- **Not started** - the invite was accepted, but the candidate has not clicked
  Start yet.
- **In progress** - the candidate has started and the clock is running.
- **Submitted** - the candidate has submitted (or a timed assessment
  auto-submitted). A due-date submission after the deadline is still Submitted
  and [flagged late](/assessments/candidate-experience/#timed-vs-due-date).

Those three chips are the source-sidebar states. A grade (autograde or a human
score) does not add a fourth chip here. After every accepted clone is submitted
and graded, the **source** itself moves to **Past assessments** in the workspace
switcher - see [Reviewing
submissions](/assessments/reviewing-submissions/#where-the-source-lives).

The list refreshes when you return to the tab or use the refresh control, so you
see a new acceptance or a state change without reloading the page.

Hiring users also see these candidates on the [Candidate
Dashboard](/assessments/candidate-experience/#candidate-dashboard) in the app
menu, across take-homes, without opening each source.

## Roles

Only reviewer-side roles (**owner**, **admin**, **interviewer**) on the source
assessment can send invites and see submissions. The candidate is scoped to their
own clone and never sees the source, other candidates, or the rubric.
